# EscapeGame
## Brief Introduction

This is our COMP2522 JavaFX game project. After two weeks of planning what we wanted to program and designing a class diagram, we programmed for a week to create the game. We had no prior knowledge of JavaFX, and no formal lessons. Between the deadlines, we had to have a minimum prototype of our game working to present it in a lab. After successfully presenting our project, we completed it the weekend after. In future updates, we wish to implement more levels into the game, create some more abstractions for our code, and create better puzzles. Overall, we did prove to ourselves that we could get a minimum implementation of the game working by a strict deadline -- a satisfactory result.

## How to run the game
To run our game, head to the ApplicationRunner class and please add the following to your run configuration: <br>
VM options: --module-path "**[lib folder from your JavaFX library]**" --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml,javafx.media <br>
